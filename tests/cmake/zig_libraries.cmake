# Fully migrated: the record core and the production extra-MRAM store binding

# Runtime path only so far: put / get / read / evict / pin / sync / close are
# Zig, while the mount and recovery TU (ra8_cache_store_mount.c) is still C and
# still defines the seven priv_cache_store_* helpers this archive calls. The
# RA8_CACHE_STORE_SOURCES glob in tests_storage.cmake therefore stays, now
# matching that one file. The cache-store targets consume ra8_core_hal through
# $<TARGET_OBJECTS:>, which carries no link dependencies, so they link this
# archive by name in tests_storage.cmake rather than through the list below.
